**Question 1: What is the link to your github repository for this lab?**
- https://github.com/Sean-Meyers/CMPUT404-Lab-4-Django

**Question 2: After starting a brand new Django application and running the runserver command, what does the browser show you?**
- It shows me a page with a fancy rocket that says "The install worked successfully! Congratulations! You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs." It has links to Django documentation, tutorial, and community, and release notes.

**Question 3: After creating the first view within polls, what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?**
-

**Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them?**
-

**Question 5: What do you see after you log into the Django adminstration site? From a high levle, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page?**
-

**Question 6: What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? What happens when you donâ€™t put a number, and instead use a string? How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?**
-

**Question 7: Why is it a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates?**
-

**Question 8: What are the benefits of using Django's generic views over writing views 'the hard way'? When should you use a generic view and when shouldn't you use a generic view?**
